Finally, after days of configuring this blog, I get down to the business - the writing/blogging part itself. 

Writing this very first post is terrifying, even though I used to be a passionate blogger back in my college days. It’s been quite some years since then. Back then, I wrote hundreds of blog posts in my native language with confidence. Now you see - I’m not a native speaker of English.

But being a non-native English speaker is no excuse. The only way to improve my English writing skill is to write as often as I can. Being afraid of getting judged or criticized is an inborn trait within every human being. But let’s just fuck perfectionism. Why should I care that much as a beginner? :)

I once read that the most effective way to overcome writer’s block is probably to write the way you talk - there is a mental block for beginner writers like me, but there is no such thing as a talker’s block. The concept of [freewriting](https://writingprocess.mit.edu/process/step-1-generate-ideas/instructions/freewriting) also helps a lot. In that sense, writing is pretty much like coding: write first, fix later.

So I’m going to write every week from now on. For now, the goal is simple (yet challenging). I’ll write about things I’ve learned recently. It could be anything - technical stuff or just thoughts on life. Developing the habit of writing is much more important than the quality of the post itself. Never let perfectionism get in the way when you try to achieve something more significant in the long run.

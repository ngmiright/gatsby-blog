As a self-taught developer, I know what it’s like feeling "ngmi" (not gonna make it) when first starting out. Everything that relates to programming seems so daunting that I don’t even think I can pull this off. It could be fairly frustrating as well getting stuck building your first project. If you’ve ever felt the same way, read on.

After learning web development on and off for about two years (as of March 2023), I’ve made up my mind to switch my career to full-time web development. So this blog is a place for me to document my journey and push myself to land that very first developer job. 

Please take everything on this blog with a grain of salt, like any critical thinker always does. After all I’m just another progressing learner that makes mistakes often. Correct me if I’m wrong. Huge thanks in advance :)
